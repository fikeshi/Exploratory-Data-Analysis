This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a household(census) dataset.
The goal was to understand the structure of the data, handle missing values and visualize key insights.

Files:
- `census.ipynb` — Main notebook with all code and analysis
- `W-T2_A24census-5.csv` — Dataset(cvs format)

Features:
1) Data preprocessing (handling missing values, type conversion, cleaning)

2)Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Summary statistics
    - Missing values check
    - Distributions & relationships
    - Correlation analysis with heatmaps
    - Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Tech Stack:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

How to Run:
1. Clone this repo or download the notebook.
2. Open `census.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
3. Run the cells step by step
